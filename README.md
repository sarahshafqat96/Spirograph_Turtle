# Project Summary

Using python's Turtle library, I built a GUI which would draw a spirograph pattern using circles of random colors on a blank screen.
Spirographs are geometric designs that can be created by tracing the path of a point on a circle as it rolls around the inside or outside of another circle. 
This project demonstrates the basics of the Turtle library and provides an interesting application of mathematical concepts.
